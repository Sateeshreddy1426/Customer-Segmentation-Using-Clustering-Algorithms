# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Algorithms

This repository contains a project on Customer Segmentation using various Clustering Algorithms. The goal of the project was to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics to help businesses develop more targeted marketing strategies.

By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, this model identifies distinct groups of customers with similar behavior, allowing for better customer insights and more personalized engagement.

Clustering Techniques Used
K-Means Clustering: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on similarity. Used to group customers based on features such as age, income, purchase frequency, and product categories.

Hierarchical Clustering: A technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters, helping in understanding the relationships between customers and visualizing the clusters through dendrograms.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based clustering algorithm that detects core clusters and can handle noise in the data, ideal for identifying customer segments with varying densities.

Key Steps
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Cleaned and transformed the dataset.
Handled missing values and scaled data to ensure the features were in the same range.
Performed feature engineering to select the most relevant attributes for clustering.
Clustering & Model Evaluation:

Applied K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
Used evaluation techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters and assess the quality of the clustering results.
Data Visualization:

Visualized clusters using matplotlib and seaborn.
Created dendrograms to showcase hierarchical clustering results.
Visualized customer segmentation results to gain insights into group behaviors.
